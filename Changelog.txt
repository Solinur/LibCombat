[*] Fixed an issue where damage to shields was not properly counted. 
[*] Fixed an issue where resource values where sometimes missing in death recaps.

40 DL: 857.823 (04.12.2020) 22:38
[*] Fixed Major Force value since it was still set to 15% (Thx to @Wrath of Innos)

39 DL: 853.895 (04.12.2020) 21:09
[*] Fixed an issue where heals would fail to be recorded.
[*] Removed some debug spam

38 DL: 827.056 (03.12.2020) 00:19
[*] Changed the way damage versus absorbing shields is handled. The shield event will be shown as usual but sent with the Heal callbacks. The combat event for damage callback will now send the normal event with the proper action result and contain the shielded fraction in the overflow field.
[*] Adjusted handling of shields in combat log string creation
[*] Added workaround for Minor Magickasteal
[*] Added some adjustments to skill timing after ZOS changed something again to fix LA weaving

37 DL: 727.555 (20.10.2020) 23:47
[*] Removed skill timing events firing when out of combat

36 DL: 684.988 (14.10.2020) 00:19
[*] Reworked skill timing to fix several issues. Now also the input registration and queue activation will trigger a callback 
[*] Added some code that might help in cases where combat end is not properly detected.

35 DL: 613.284 (20.09.2020) 19:35
[*] Fixed penetration values for TFS. While the penetration API function is not doing what it should either (its not tracking stacks higher than 1 at all), the wrong value was my fault. Should work fine now, I hope.

34 DL: 605.035 (20.09.2020) 12:41
[*] Reverted critical damage bonus calculation to the previous method, since the ZOS tooltip hast turned out to be inaccurate.
[*] Physical penetration values are not working correctly when TFS is involved. The underlying API function is bugged and applies the old increase of 860 pen for every stack higher or equal than two. I will fix this if possible, but it will require some work.

33 DL: 576.257 (17.09.2020) 19:55
[*] Corrected the calculation for critical damage values to mind the new values from shadow mundus. It will now extract the value from the same tooltip which you can see in the character window, instead of using a hard coded base value and the extracted bonus from divine pieces.
[*] Some small fixes and changes for future use.

32 DL: 491.085 (24.08.2020) 10:11
[*] API Bump to Stonethorn (100032)
[*] Added special tracking for the new Alkosh penetration debuff
[*] Small fixes

31 DL: 351.931 (09.06.2020) 23:15
[*] Put back tracking of skill timings for Necro Siphon since it is back on GCD
[*] Removed tracking of skill timing for Blood Frenzy and it's morphs, since they are off the GCD
[*] Fixed an issue where a lua error would appear if an old version of libdebuglogger was installed

30 DL: 266,183 (23.05.2020) 22:53
[*] Fixed some issues with skill timing events. (Thx @ wraith1515 for reporting)

29 DL: 233,394 (20.05.2020 00:53)
[*] Fixed a lua error that could happen when leaving Battleground or Cyrodil in some cases

28 DL: 215,702 (18.05.2020 23:29)
[*] Fixed a lua error that could happen when leaving Battleground or Cyrodil in some cases

27 DL: 199,430 (17.05.2020 22:26)
[*] Reworked event registration functions (e.g. lib:RegisterForCombatEvent). The behaviour and syntax now matches event registration of the ESO API (EVENT_MANAGER:RegisterForEvent). The old functions are still supported but may be removed in the future.
[*] LibCombat:RegisterCallbackType(callbacktype, callback, name) --> LibCombat:RegisterForCombatEvent(name, callbacktype, callback), returns: isRegistered
[*] LibCombat:UnregisterCallbackType(callbacktype, callback, name) --> LibCombat:UnregisterForCombatEvent(name, callbacktype), returns: isUnregistered
[*] LibCombat:RegisterAllLogCallbacks(callback, name) --> LibCombat:RegisterForLogableCombatEvents(name, callback)
[*] LibCombat now optionally depends on libdebuglogger. It is set up to handle all debug output and also saves them for later review. When it is not installed no debug output will be shown.
[*] Small fixes and performance improvements.
[*] Added new events for performance (ping, fps).
[*] Added field skillDelay to LIBCOMBAT_EVENT_SKILL_TIMINGS events.
[*] Changed boss assignment to not just check if unit is a boss on unit initialization but all the time.
[*] Consolidated the preliminary event LIBCOMBAT_EVENT_RESURRECTION into LIBCOMBAT_EVENT_DEATH. This one is still work in progress.

26 DL: 98,320 (22.03.2020 17:05)
[*] Fixed an issue that prevented display names (@Names) to be added to unit info

25 DL: 45,830 (25.02.2020 23:11)
[*] Updated ability IDs used in a couple of places, since ZOS seemed to have removed a few.

24 DL: 0
[*] initial release as standalone library
[*] fixed formatting issue in log for stats
[*] fixed issue with crit damage values when buff is only refreshed but not applied completely new
