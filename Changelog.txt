46 DL: 1.222.560  (08.03.2021) 21:42

[*] Fixed Major Force value since it was still set to 15% (Thx to @Wrath of Innos)

39 DL: 853.895 (04.12.2020) 21:09

[*] Removed some debug spam

38 DL: 827.056 (03.12.2020) 00:19
[*] Changed the way damage versus absorbing shields is handled. The shield event will be shown as usual but sent with the Heal callbacks. The combat event for damage callback will now send the normal event with the proper action result and contain the shielded fraction in the overflow field.
[*] Adjusted handling of shields in combat log string creation
[*] Added workaround for Minor Magickasteal
[*] Added some adjustments to skill timing after ZOS changed something again to fix LA weaving

37 DL: 727.555 (20.10.2020) 23:47
[*] Removed skill timing events firing when out of combat

36 DL: 684.988 (14.10.2020) 00:19
[*] Reworked skill timing to fix several issues. Now also the input registration and queue activation will trigger a callback 
[*] Added some code that might help in cases where combat end is not properly detected.

35 DL: 613.284 (20.09.2020) 19:35
[*] Fixed penetration values for TFS. While the penetration API function is not doing what it should either (its not tracking stacks higher than 1 at all), the wrong value was my fault. Should work fine now, I hope.

34 DL: 605.035 (20.09.2020) 12:41
[*] Reverted critical damage bonus calculation to the previous method, since the ZOS tooltip hast turned out to be inaccurate.
[*] Physical penetration values are not working correctly when TFS is involved. The underlying API function is bugged and applies the old increase of 860 pen for every stack higher or equal than two. I will fix this if possible, but it will require some work.

33 DL: 576.257 (17.09.2020) 19:55
[*] Corrected the calculation for critical damage values to mind the new values from shadow mundus. It will now extract the value from the same tooltip which you can see in the character window, instead of using a hard coded base value and the extracted bonus from divine pieces.
[*] Some small fixes and changes for future use.

32 DL: 491.085 (24.08.2020) 10:11

27 DL: 199,430 (17.05.2020 22:26)
[*] Reworked event registration functions (e.g. lib:RegisterForCombatEvent). The behaviour and syntax now matches event registration of the ESO API (EVENT_MANAGER:RegisterForEvent). The old functions are still supported but may be removed in the future.
[*] LibCombat:RegisterCallbackType(callbacktype, callback, name) --> LibCombat:RegisterForCombatEvent(name, callbacktype, callback), returns: isRegistered
[*] LibCombat:UnregisterCallbackType(callbacktype, callback, name) --> LibCombat:UnregisterForCombatEvent(name, callbacktype), returns: isUnregistered
[*] LibCombat:RegisterAllLogCallbacks(callback, name) --> LibCombat:RegisterForLogableCombatEvents(name, callback)
[*] LibCombat now optionally depends on libdebuglogger. It is set up to handle all debug output and also saves them for later review. When it is not installed no debug output will be shown.

[*] Added new events for performance (ping, fps).
[*] Added field skillDelay to LIBCOMBAT_EVENT_SKILL_TIMINGS events.
[*] Changed boss assignment to not just check if unit is a boss on unit initialization but all the time.
[*] Consolidated the preliminary event LIBCOMBAT_EVENT_RESURRECTION into LIBCOMBAT_EVENT_DEATH. This one is still work in progress.

[*] Fixed an issue that prevented display names (@Names) to be added to unit info

25 DL: 45,830 (25.02.2020 23:11)
