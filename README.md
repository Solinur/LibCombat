# LibCombat2

## Description

**LibCombat2 is currently at a very incomplete stage. It is released as an early alpha to bring the parts that are running to console.** 

This library is supposed to provide the data collection for Combat Metrics. 
However I tried to make it in such a way it can be used for other addons which may only need parts of the data.
Additionally it can provide human readable combat log lines, which are arranged so they should be translatable.
I tried to optimize the code to impact the performance as little as possible.

## API Implementation

See the [API Documentation](docs/api.md) for details.
